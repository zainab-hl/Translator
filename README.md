Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample Jakarta EE application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter.

About This Project
This project is a RESTful API service that performs automatic translation from Latin-based languages to Moroccan Darija (Arabic dialect).
It leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API for language understanding and generation.

üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions
You can build the application by executing the following command from the project root.
Please ensure you have installed a Java SE implementation appropriate for your Jakarta EE version (this sample assumes Java SE 17).
Note: The Maven Wrapper is already included, so Maven installation is not required.
You may first need to run:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x mvnw
Then build using:

bash
Copy
Edit
./mvnw clean package
This will generate a file named:

bash
Copy
Edit
target/jakartaee-hello-world.war
You can deploy it to any Jakarta EE compatible runtime (e.g., WildFly, Payara, GlassFish) to run the service.
